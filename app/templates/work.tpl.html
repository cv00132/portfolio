        Barkspark
      </h1>
      <p class="project-description">
          BarkSpark was designed with dog lovers in mind. The idea arose from the lack of dating sites that targeted pet owners. I love spending time with my dog, and wanted a way to connect with others while spending time with my bud, Earl.

          General Knowledge is a military themed trivia game built using object oriented principles and pulling questions from the jService API. Players choose a category and then have 15sec to answer the question. Selected questions go away after they're chosen, so choose wisely!

        Prost!
      </h1>
      <p class="project-description">
          Prost! is a responsive website designed for a German bierhaus. It uses multiple API calls including a custom API to populate the menu, flickr to pull in the photos, and Google Maps to generate a localized map of the area. It was built in collaboration with a partner by peer programming and A/B testing.
