    BarkSpark was designed with dog lovers in mind. The idea came about when I was hanging around at my local dog park and thought, "There has to be a better way for getting through first dates?" Then it hit me, why not bring along my favorite wingman, Earl (my handsome hound)? And thus BarkSpark was born.

    General Knowledge is a military themed, object-oriented trivia game. Players choose a random category and then have 15sec to answer the question. Selected questions go away after they're chosen, so choose wisely!

    Prost! was one of my first big projects, as well as, the first time I worked with a partner. I learned a lot going through the design process and I realized that compromise is key when deciding which features to add, styles to use, and how all of it goes together.

    Vaughan's Songs was a simple app created using Soundcloud's API. It was the first time I was given freedom to create a project with no boilerplate. Even though I only had a few days and I overhauled the design multiple time, I'm still very happy with how it turned out.
