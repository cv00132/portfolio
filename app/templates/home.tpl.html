        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p class="is-left">After graduating Georgia Southern University I began my career working for a REIT (real estate investment trust), Waypoint Homes. After three years in which I spent most of my time writing ad copy, taking photographs, and scrounging up statistics for marketing meetings my time at Waypoint came to an end. The company was acquired by a competitor and I began the long journey of finding another job. After meeting with a few colleagues and discussing their issues as realtors, I had an idea. This lead me to start freelancing as a real estate photographer. After a year of hitting almost every corner of metro Atlanta, I realized that I missed being part of a team. Although I enjoyed my time as a marketing professional and freelancer I knew I wanted a career that challenged me with solving complex problems while fulfilling my need to be part of a team. I began studying programming through online courses and my old college textbooks. After discovering that I enjoyed the thrill of solving problems through code I decided to take the next step in my development. I completed Codecademy's Ready program, which was a 6-week online bootcamp I felt I needed more. I then enrolled in The Iron Yard's 12-week Front End Development program in January. It had turned out to be the best decision I had made. From HTML to CSS to Javascript, I was exposed to the world of engineering and I realized I had found my fit. I am know looking to further my development and continue down this exciting path into the future of web development.</p>
